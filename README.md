# KUbeSatPiCam
Repo for the KUbeSat-1 Raspberry Pi Camera code. Hopefully my collaborators will put future code as branches to this one...

There are two read me documents. One goes over how to operate the RPi remotely. This is pretty much required for a lab test as you'll need to be able to remotely operate the RPi while it takes pictures of samples.

The other read me document covers the progress of the code and the date it was originally authored.
